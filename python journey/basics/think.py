# Sure, let's calculate it step by step using Python:

# ```python
# Define the distance in kilometers
distance_km = 10

# Define the time in minutes
time_minutes = 43 * 60 + 30  # Convert 43 minutes 30 seconds to seconds

# Convert kilometers to miles (1 mile = 1.61 kilometers)
distance_miles = distance_km / 1.61

# Calculate average time per mile in minutes
average_time_per_mile = time_minutes / distance_miles

# Calculate average speed in miles per hour
average_speed_mph = (distance_miles / (time_minutes / 60))

# Print the results
print("Average time per mile:", average_time_per_mile, "minutes")
print("Average speed:", average_speed_mph, "miles per hour")
# ```

# Running this code in the Python interpreter will give you the desired results.
